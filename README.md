Have created this project using Node.js and Socket.IO to monitor the real time memory usage of the system. This project is very useful for the system administrators to monitor the memory usage of the system.

This is a very basic project and can be extended to monitor the CPU usage, Disk usage, Network usage etc.

Free Memory and Total Memory will be taken from **OS Module** under **Node.js**. This will be sent to the client using **Socket.IO**. The client will receive the data and will be displayed in the browser using **HTTP Module** which is also under **Node.js**.

### The Socket.io documentation can be found at: https://socket.io/docs/v4/.
